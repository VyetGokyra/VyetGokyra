# Hi! ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) My name is Viet Tien Pham

## üöÄ AI Engineer

I'm an **AI Engineer and Researcher** passionate about building intelligent systems that understand and interact with humans naturally.  

I have solid experience working on **speech technologies**, including:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (**ASR**)
- Speaker Verification (**SV**)
- Text-to-Speech (**TTS**)
- Audio Large Language Models (**Audio LLMs**)

I enjoy designing **callbot center solutions**, conversational AI, and human-robot interaction systems, where the ability to process and generate natural speech plays a critical role.

During my **university years**, I worked extensively on **computer vision and deep learning**, focusing on:
- Image segmentation
- Image classification
- Few-shot segmentation
- Object detection

This foundation helped me develop strong skills in designing and fine-tuning large-scale models, as well as integrating them into real-world applications.

On the **research side**, I'm interested in:
- Reasoning with LLMs
- Reinforcement Learning (**RL**) for optimizing conversational strategies
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**) for enhancing knowledge-grounded dialogue systems

My technical background spans both model development and deployment, covering end-to-end speech pipelines, advanced audio feature engineering, and multi-modal reasoning capabilities.

I always aim to **bridge the gap between state-of-the-art research and impactful user-facing products** ‚Äî from scalable voicebots for customer service to advanced vision and speech-based interactive systems.
